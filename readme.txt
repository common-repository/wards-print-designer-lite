Ward's Print Designer allows customer to add text to a customizable print area on woocommerce products. 

1) Print Area Setup
A new tab named Ward's Print Designer Setup is added to every product in the product setup screen.
This tab allows you to set which products have print areas and select which product images will have a print area.
You can add one print area per product image, allowing for multiple print areas on the same product.
You can position the print area wherever you like on each product image.
The border color and default text color can also be set to no conflict with the color of the target product.
The print aree settings are saved on product updates.

2) Print Design
When the customer views a product, all the product images are loaded with the print areas on each according to the setup saved in step one.
A menu is added below each menu with contols to add text and images to the print area.
The color and font of the text can be changed.
Text can be resized and rotated.
When the customer adds the product to their cart, the added print is saved to the order.

3) Order Management
In WordPress when viewing orders that have a print added in the admin menu, all product images are displayed with the customers prints added for an order preview.
A Save Printable Area as Image button is added to each print area in the order.
This button will save the submitted prints, with all modifications, as png files ready to add to your printing process.
